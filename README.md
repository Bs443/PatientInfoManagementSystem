## Introduction

The Patient Information Management System (PIMS) is a Python-based application designed to streamline the process of storing, updating, and retrieving crucial patient data in a user-friendly and intuitive manner.

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Database
PIMS employs a dictionary-based database structure to meticulously store essential patient information. Each patient is uniquely identified by a Hospital Number (HN), and the system captures a range of data, including personal details, medical history, and contact information.

### 2. User-Friendly Interface
The graphical user interface, crafted using the Tkinter library, ensures that healthcare professionals can navigate the system effortlessly. The intuitive design facilitates quick access to vital functionalities such as patient admission, data updates, searches, and deletions.

### 3. Data Validation and Error Handling
PIMS incorporates robust data validation mechanisms to ensure the accuracy and integrity of entered information. User inputs are carefully validated, and the system provides informative error messages to guide users in case of discrepancies.

### 4. Holistic Patient Management:
The system goes beyond basic data storage, offering features such as patient admission, updating existing records, searching for specific patients, and deleting outdated information. This comprehensive approach allows healthcare providers to manage patient data efficiently.

### 5. Dynamic Data Display
PIMS provides a dynamic data display through a Database View window, offering a clear and organized presentation of patient records. This view enables healthcare professionals to assess and analyze patient information seamlessly.
